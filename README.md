📊 Data Analytics Project – Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis
🔍 Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analytics and visualization pipeline designed to analyze customer shopping behavior and extract meaningful business insights.
The complete workflow includes:
Loading and processing data using Python
Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Cleaning and preparing data for analysis
Running SQL queries on a PostgreSQL server
Building an interactive Power BI dashboard
Creating a detailed analytical report
Preparing a professional PowerPoint presentation
The goal of this project is to support data-driven decision-making by identifying trends, patterns, and customer behavior insights.

📁 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains customer shopping and transaction data (2023–2024) with approximately 3,900+ rows and 18+ columns.
Key Columns Included:
Customer Demographics: Gender, Location, Age
Purchase Details: Category, Item Purchased, Color, Season
Financial Information: Purchase Amount, Discounts Applied, Promotions Used
Shopping Behavior: Purchase Frequency, Previous Purchases, Payment Method
Customer Feedback: Ratings
📌 Missing values (37 records in the rating column) were identified and handled during data cleaning.
🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python – Data loading, EDA, and cleaning
Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Visual analysis
PostgreSQL (SQL) – Query-based data insights
Power BI – Interactive dashboards
Microsoft Word – Analytical report
Microsoft PowerPoint – Business presentation
